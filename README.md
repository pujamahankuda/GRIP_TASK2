From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predicting the optimum number of clusters and representing it visually.

In this task, I had to use an unsupervised ML algorithm to predict the optimum number of clusters for the Iris Dataset. 

K-means clustering algorithm is used here where with the help of the "Elbow Method", I was able to determine the optimum number of clusters.
Here, the "Elbow Method" is used to determine the ideal number of clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm.

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid. The algorithm aims to minimize the squared Euclidean distances between the observation and the centroid of a cluster to which it belongs. 
An unsupervised learning algorithm called K-means clustering aims to divide n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster that has the closest centroid. The algorithm's goal is to reduce the observation's squared Euclidean distance from the cluster's centroid.
